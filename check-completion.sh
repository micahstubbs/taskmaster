REASON="${LABEL}: ${PREAMBLE}

Before stopping, do each of these checks:

1. RE-READ THE ORIGINAL USER MESSAGE(S). List every discrete request or acceptance criterion. For each one, confirm it is fully addressed — not just started, FULLY done. If the user explicitly changed their mind, withdrew a request, or told you to stop or skip something, treat that item as resolved and do NOT continue working on it.
2. CHECK THE TASK LIST. Review every task. Any task not marked completed? Do it now — unless the user indicated it is no longer wanted.
3. CHECK THE PLAN. Walk through each step. Any step skipped or partially done? Finish it — unless the user redirected or deprioritized it.
4. CHECK FOR ERRORS. Did any tool call, build, test, or lint fail? Fix it.
5. CHECK FOR LOOSE ENDS. Any TODO comments, placeholder code, missing tests, or follow-ups noted but not acted on?

IMPORTANT: The user's latest instructions always take priority. If the user said to stop, move on, or skip something, respect that — do not force completion of work the user no longer wants.

If after this review everything is genuinely 100% done (or explicitly deprioritized by the user), briefly confirm completion for each user request. Otherwise, immediately continue working on whatever remains — do not just describe what is left, ACTUALLY DO IT."
